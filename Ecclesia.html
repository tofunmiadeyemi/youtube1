			Ecclesia with Good Christian Music states in a recent statement that all he intends to do is to 'surrender it all to Jesus' with this track as he makes his debut release with his new record label with this powerful and intense track that will bring anyone to their knees in worship and reverence of Jehovah Nissi. I believe in miracles, I’ve seen broken lives healed by broken hands, In spite of all the obstacles, I’ve seen humble feet choose to take a stand, Who’s to say I’m not a miracle?, Who’s to say that I’m not wonderfully made?, Who’s to say this mess ain’t fixable?, Who’s to say my God could never make a change?
